#+TITLE: Timings for HW3 code

Here, are some timings for the code. The code was run on my CIMS
desktop which has 4 cores. The different number of threads are set
using the environmental variable =OMP_NUM_THREADS=. The first columns
contains entries which are formatted like =N(number of iterations)=.
I am not sure if implemented these in the most efficient manner, but
there only seem to be speed gains for very large =N=.

I put an =omp parallel= block within the loop in this version, but it
did not speed up at all when having only one =omp parallel= block. The
most difficult aspect of the code was making the reduction work
without global variables.
